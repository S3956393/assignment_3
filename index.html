					<h3>Polina Klishina</h3>
					<p>Polina Klishina (Student ID: S3956393) moved to Australia from Russia 3 years ago. She is an overseas qualified lawyer and works as a paralegal in a law firm in Sydney. Polina enjoys hiking, rock climbing and art. Her interest in IT (Information Technology) started a few years ago after trying some Codecademy courses. Polina is interested in front end and UX design and she does not have any prior experience in IT. </p>
					<p>According to Polina's Myers Briggs test results, she is a Turbulent Logician (INTP-T) and analyst. This type represents a socially selective, rational person who is driven by self-improvement. Logicians tend to get tired out by extensive socializing, they prefer exchanging ideas instead. They are strong at analysing information and producing creative ideas. Learning styles quiz showed that Polina's learning style is reflector, which means she is cautious and takes her time to collect the information. The recommended study methods for reflectors are paired discussions, demonstrations, and feedback from others. Psychometrics Project test revealed that Polina is introverted yet friendly and optimistic, as well as highly organised and diligent. These results show that Polina is good at generating ideas which is important for the group. Being organised and diligent is crucial for meeting deadlines and making sure the task is completed properly. </p>
					<h3>Ryan Bodzioch</h3>
					<p>Ryan Bodzioch (Student ID: S3951227) lives in regional South Australia after residing in Adelaide for most of his life. Ryan has worked as an automotive mechanic and embarked on a profession in transport and logistics before a career ending back injury. His passion for IT began through exposure to diagnostics by an old family friend, though Ryan has no genuine experience in the field. His back injury has provided him the opportunity to start his university qualification in IT. Ryan has a menagerie at home, consisting of 2 dogs, 3 cats and a goat. In his spare time, Ryan enjoys gaming, particularly NES, SNES and N64 games. </p>
					<p>Using the Myer-Briggs test from 16personalities, Ryan’s result was a Turbulent Mediator (INFP-T) personality. The result from this test shows he is an empathetic person in touch with his emotions. It confirms that he is an active listener and enjoys harmonious relationships with others. Being introverted can be challenging when beginning to work in a group situation as he can feel anxious when stepping outside his comfort zone. The second test Ryan participated in was his learning style through Matrix Education. This test identified Ryan as a physical learner who will find online learning a challenge. The final test Ryan completed was the Big Five Personality Test using Truity. This test indicated Ryan is creative, adventurous, and intellectual, whilst also empathetic toward others. The test revealed he can exercise self-discipline but will also engage in instant gratification at times. This test reaffirmed his introverted tendencies and identified he has a mid-range level of neuroticism. In a group setting, Ryan will be empathetic to everyone’s ideas and will generally be agreeable. He will view their perspectives with ease. Ryan’s challenge in these circumstances, however, is to find the confidence to speak out and have his voice heard as this is stepping outside of his comfort zone. </p>
					<h3>Silas Greatorix</h3>
					<p>Silas Greatorix (Student ID: S3955553) is 18 years old and has recently enrolled into the Introduction to programming and the Introduction to Information Technology courses at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) University. He currently lives in Murwillumbah, NSW with his family. Having never participated in any form of programming or IT courses, Silas expects the next couple of weeks to be a challenge and a fantastic kick start to the world of IT. Silas first became interested in 2011, when he was given a Wii as a present. Before 2011 his only experience with IT was the use of PowerPoint and Word. And whilst he would not know what he would do without these applications now, they were excruciatingly boring to him as a child. In his spare time Silas enjoys gaming, specifically RTS games, learning other languages and listening to podcasts. </p>
					<p>Silas’ personality results from the Myers-Briggs test show that he is an Advocate (INFJ-T) personality type. An Advocate personality type is quite introverted and tends to look at life with an open and imaginative mind. Advocates are not content floating their way through life and often strive to do the best they can in whatever it is that they are doing. For an advocate type person, success comes from helping those round them and living a fulfilling life. Silas’ personality results obtained from The VARK questionnaire, show that his learning style is Multimodal, this means that he has multiple learning styles, his top learning styles being: Visual and kinaesthetic meaning he learns best when he is reading or writing notes and taking part of an activity that affirms what he is reading or hearing about. Silas’ personality test results from The Big Five personality test conflict with his results from the Myers-Briggs Test, stating that I am an extroverted, open, conscientious, neurotic, and agreeable person. Taking each of these results into consideration, it is safe to say that Silas would struggle in a group setting not because of a lack of effort but a fear of communicating with his group mates. Silas would work best in a group of people who are extraverted people who he can communicate with without feeling anxious. </p>
					<h3>Tereza Gordon</h3>
					<p>Tereza Gordon (Student ID: S3985235) is a 19-year-old student based in Melbourne. She has some experience in Python and Java, as well as some basic HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript knowledge. Tereza has an interest in computer graphics, especially in films, and software engineering. In her free time like to read comic books in her free time, draw and write some simple programs in Python. Her interest in IT first began in primary school during her Robotics class where she programmed Lego Mindstorms and created games using Scratch. </p>
					<p>On the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator test, Tereza was typed as an INTJ-A with the role of an analyst and confident individualism as the strategy. Most of the results were close to being evenly split between the scales, with the exception of the Introversion/Extroversion scale which heavily skewed towards introversion, so this means that there is a balance. Tereza received a multimodal learning preference result from the VARK Questionnaire with scores that are as follows: 10 for visual, 5 for aural, 8 for read/write and 8 for kinaesthetic. The scores are quite similar for each of the learning styles which shows that she learns in a variety of ways and not just one method for everything. On the Big 5 personality test Tereza had a high agreeability and openness scores, which shows that Tereza is incredibly open to hearing the thoughts of others and doing what they would like to do. In relation to the low score for the neuroticism trait, this would mean that if something goes wrong, she is quite resilient and can bounce back quite quickly.  </p>

					<h2>Group Processes</h2>
					</a id>
					<p>The Assignment 2 outcomes could have been better as we missed some points on the group reflection part and IT technologies section. As a group we mostly worked as individuals and split tasks up unevenly. We unfortunately did not put much information into the project ideas section as this was a section, we should have worked as a group. Meetings at the beginning of forming the group and discussing the assignment were unorganized as we were all new to working as a group online. Towards the end of Assignment 2 meetings were more organized and we eventually got the biggest parts of the assignment sorted out. With the website of the assignment, only Ryan and Polina were uploading text to the template Ryan made. This made it difficult at the later stages as Ryan was inputting copious amounts of text on the submission day, albeit copy and pasting from the report but did impact the result at the end. </p>
					<p>Hence, for the Assignment 3 we have introduced some changes within our work process. We have split up the work more properly and the work was assigned to team members according to their preferences so everyone could have their area of expertise. We aimed to work together more as a group instead of working as individuals as this was a major problem in assignment 2 regarding the project idea. Polina and Tereza were assigned to work on the project idea and create the website for the project. Ryan was tasked to create the website template using the Assignment 2 website, write some of a portion of the report, and was chairperson for most of the meetings. Silas was tasked to write much of the report as he said in one of the earlier meetings, he found programming was not one of his strengths and preferred to write. Regarding the website for the report, all members are to input portions of the text instead of Ryan having to do most of the work with the website. </p>
